* If you can, I highly recommend using deferred lighting. In forward rendering Verdant will be rendered multiple times for each light, which can get very expensive.
* Lights with shadow casting will always cause Verdant to render a shadow pass one time per light. Be extra careful with these, and if you donâ€™t need them you can disable shadows completely on your Verdant Type or limit them to the first LOD. On low performance systems this can sometimes double your framerate!
