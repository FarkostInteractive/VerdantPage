## Tips and Tricks for working around limitations

## This makes something look terrible! / My game absolutely needs feature X!
Unfortunately, these tradeoffs are fundamental parts of the design of Verdant. If any of its quirks are dealbreakers for you, Verdant might just be a bad fit for your project. There are many other excellent vegetation systems out there that use a more traditional paradigm, which will probably be closer to your needs. You can even use another system in conjunction with Verdant, or implement your own alongside it! If you know your needs and performance requirements, building a basic vegetation system is actually not that hard. Engines are getting better at handling fine detail every year, and there’s a million tutorials out there for shader solutions. If you want to integrate Verdant into your own systems, check the page for Accessing Verdant Data.

(Completely unrelated, but I might be available for freelancing!) 

## The Future
Suffice it to say, I believe enough in the design of Verdant to constantly be frustrated by its limitations. I’m always looking for ways to surpass them, and I’m actually documenting some of my thoughts on the page Verdant 2.0. Since most of these isses require fundamental structural changes I can’t guarantee that anything there will ever come to pass, but hopefully it’s interesting and provides some insight for why the limitations are what they are in the first place. And whenever the actual Verdant 2.0 comes around, you’ll know exactly what motivated its design!
