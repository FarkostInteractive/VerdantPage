# Component Reference

The component reference contains descriptions of all the various components in Verdant as well as their parameters and public scripting interfaces. This is the first place to check if you are having trouble understanding a particular setting or the relationships between parts in the system.

As a rule, any parameters described here can be set both from the editor and from scripts. Be aware though that most components have a function that needs to be called before these changes are applied to the backend and take effect in your scene.
