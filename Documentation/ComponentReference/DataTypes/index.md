# Data Types

These are assets used by Verdant to store configurations for different types of vegetation. You can think of them as materials specifically for Verdant, though unlike most materials they also influence a range of things aside from the behaviour of light on the surface. 

You can create Verdant data types in your Project view by right clicking the window or using the + button and then selecting them under the category Verdant.

Unlike components, the parameters of data types are currently inaccessible to scripts, both at runtime and in the editor.
