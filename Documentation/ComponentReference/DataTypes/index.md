# Data Types

These are assets used by Verdant to store configurations for different types of vegetation. They contain information about surface appearance, but also things like what mesh to use, how to place instances and how their animations should be calculated.

You can create Verdant data types in your Project view by right clicking the window or using the + button and then selecting them under the category Verdant.

Unlike components, the parameters of data types are currently inaccessible to scripts, both at runtime and in the editor.
