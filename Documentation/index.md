Welcome! 

The Verdant Documentation is split into four parts. There’s the user guide, which will offer you everything you need to get started and build beautiful, performant scenes. The Getting Started page will help you set up your first scene with some basic vegetation. Every subsequent page delves deeper into the various systems and how they relate to each other. 
The guide also contains some more general advice for how to best use Verdant, maximize performance and get your scene looking as pretty as possible.

If you want to delve below the surface, Central Concepts goes into detail about how Verdant works. The User Guide often links to these pages, and I highly recommend giving them a quick read whenever it does so. Many of the design elements of Verdant will make more sense if you understand the systems they interface with. Central Concepts is meant to be understandable regardless of your technical background and offer a high level survey, not to overwhelm you with technical jargon.

The Component Reference explains every available Verdant Component in detail. This is where to look for information about specific parameters, what makes one component different from another, and so forth. It is also where you’ll find the scripting reference for each component.

Finally there is the FAQ, which is always growing and changing. I try to include everything I can think of here, but as with any complex system there are many dark corners of Verdant which even I have yet to explore. If you have unanswered questions you can use the contact form to notify me and I will get back to you as soon as possible! 

There is also the Unity Forums Thread, which is likewise always growing. While I try to incorporate as much as I can into the FAQ, if you can’t find answers here it’s very worth looking through the thread anyway. It’s also a good way to get in touch with both me and other experienced users.
