# Welcome!

The Verdant Documentation is split into five parts. There's a short [Quick Start](QuickStart.md) guide that runs through all the basics just enough to get you started. Then there’s the [User Guide](UserGuide), which walks through the entire system step by step and teaches you everything you need to build beautiful, performant scenes. It contains much more detail and context than the quick start guide and I highly recommend every user read through it at least once.

The [Advanced Guide](AdvancedGuide) shows you how to use some of the more specialized systems in Verdant. They often require very specific setup which is outlined there.

The [Component Reference](ComponentReference) contains detailed documentation for every component in Verdant. This is where to look for information about specific parameters, what makes one component different from another, and so forth. It is also where you’ll find the scripting reference for each component. 

Finally there is the [FAQ](FAQ), which is always growing and changing. It is the place to go when none of the other sections have the answers you seek. I try to include everything I can think of here, but as with any complex system there are dark corners of Verdant which even I have yet to explore. If you have unanswered questions you can use the contact form to notify me and I will get back to you as soon as possible! There is also the [Unity Forums Thread](), which is likewise always growing. If you can’t find answers here it’s very worth looking through the thread. It’s also a good way to get in touch with both me and other more experienced users.

To take your first steps, either take a quick read through [Quick Start](QuickStart.md) or take the full course here [here](UserGuide/GettingStarted.html).
