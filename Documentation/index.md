# Introduction

Welcome! 

The Verdant Documentation is split into four parts. There’s the user guide, which offers you everything you need to get started and build beautiful, performant scenes. It starts from the very beginning and delves deeper from there, teaching you how to best use Verdant, avoid performance pitfalls and put all the pieces together. I recommend every user read through it at least once.

The Advanced Guide contains descriptions of how to use specific systems that are only mentioned or covered surface level in the initial guide. Make sure you follow the corresponding guide if you need to use one of them as they often have pretty specific setup processes. If none of the systems catch your interest then you are safe to ignore this part!

The Component Reference explains every available Verdant component in detail. This is where to look for information about specific parameters, what makes one component different from another, and so forth. It is also where you’ll find the scripting reference for each component. 

Finally there is the FAQ, which is always growing and changing. It is the place to go when none of the other sections have the answers you seek. I try to include everything I can think of here, but as with any complex system there are dark corners of Verdant which even I have yet to explore. If you have unanswered questions you can use the contact form to notify me and I will get back to you as soon as possible! 

There is also the [Unity Forums Thread](), which is likewise always growing. While I try to incorporate as much as I can into the FAQ, if you can’t find answers here it’s very worth looking through the thread anyway. It’s also a good way to get in touch with both me and other more experienced users.

I hope you enjoy using Verdant! To take your first steps, start [here](UserGuide/GettingStarted.html).
